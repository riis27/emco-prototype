              Hi, I’m Emily — a licensed esthetician and acne specialist who believes skin care can be evidence-based
              <em>and</em> fun. My studio is where we mix real education, advanced modalities, and a little “trippy glow”
              energy to help you feel at home in your skin again.
            </p>
            <p>
              I specialize in acne management, barrier repair, and blending in-studio treatments like Hydrafacial with
              personalized home routines that actually fit your lifestyle. No shame, no unrealistic routines, no twelve-step
              gatekeeping.
            </p>

        <!-- Skin & acne philosophy -->
        <article class="card-glass emco-page-block emco-about-card">
          <h2>Skin philosophy: results without punishment</h2>
          <p>
            Acne isn’t a moral failure or a “you’re doing skincare wrong” sentence. It’s a complex condition rooted in your
            skin type, genetics, environment, hormones, lifestyle, and products — and it deserves more than a one-size-fits-all fix.
          </p>
          <p>
            At EmCo, I take a root-cause-focused, nervous-system-respecting approach. That means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>No shaming you for your current routine or habits.</li>
            <li>Explaining the “why” behind every product and treatment we use.</li>
            <li>Designing plans that honor your schedule, budget, and energy levels.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Whether you’re dealing with chronic breakouts, texture, or post-inflammatory marks, my goal is to help you
            understand your skin so you can feel empowered long after you leave the treatment bed.
          </p>
        </article>

        <!-- Treatment & modality philosophy -->
        <article class="card-glass emco-page-block emco-about-card">
          <h2>Treatment philosophy: science + softness</h2>
          <p>
            I’m obsessed with results, but I’m equally obsessed with how you feel getting there. Your appointments are meant to be
            a grounded, safe place to decompress — not a clinical rollercoaster of surprise peels and mystery products.
          </p>
          <p>In the treatment room, I blend:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Evidence-based acne protocols (Face Reality, GlyMed+, Mixi Skincare and more).</li>
            <li>Advanced tools like Hydrafacial, targeted exfoliation, and barrier-supportive treatments.</li>
            <li>A calm, fun, “come-as-you-are” energy so you can be honest about what you need.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Every service is customized in the moment based on how your skin walks in that day — not just what’s written on
            a menu.

          <h2>Product philosophy: acne-safe, nervous-system-friendly</h2>
          <p>
            I stock products because they work, not because they’re trendy on TikTok. The lines I use and love are curated to
            be acne-safe, ethical where possible, and kind to sensitive, easily-overwhelmed skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            We build your home routine together, using:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Face Reality and other acne-focused lines for targeted correction.</li>
            <li>Soothing, barrier-supportive products to calm irritation and redness.</li>
            <li>The <a href="ingredient-checker.html">pore-clogging ingredient checker</a> to audit your current faves.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You’ll always leave with clear instructions, realistic expectations, and permission to ask a million questions.

        <h2>How EmCo Esthetics came to life</h2>
        <p>
          Like many acne specialists, my story started with my own skin. After years of cycling through harsh prescriptions,
          confusing advice, and quick fixes, I decided to study the skin from the inside out.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Esthetics training:</strong> Completed formal esthetics education and licensing, with extra focus on acne and corrective work.</li>
          <li><strong>Acne specialization:</strong> Ongoing advanced trainings in acne physiology, Face Reality protocols, and ingredient chemistry.</li>
          <li><strong>Modality training:</strong> Hands-on experience with Hydrafacial, chemical peels, and advanced treatment layering.</li>
          <li><strong>Client education:</strong> Continual learning in nervous system support, trauma-informed care, and accessible communication.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          EmCo Esthetics is the studio I wish I had when I was breaking out and overwhelmed — a place where you can bring
          your whole self, not just your skin.
